## Setup

### Server
There is not a specific way to actually host the server. You can host the `/build` folder with something like nginx. Since the project is static (only does CRUD), any http server will do.
```
git clone https://github.com/amcolash/transmission-yify.git
cd transmission-yify
npm install
npm run build
```
